# Day 4: Script Execution Permissions

### Task Overview
This task required adding executable permissions to a bash script at /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh. I first viewed permissions of the file, then ran the chmod command, and viewed permissions again to verify. "chmod a+rx" granted all users permissions to read <i>and</i> execute files, as you can't do the latter without the former.

### Key Command Notes
* **For changing permissions**: sudo chmod a+rx /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh
* **To view permissions, before and after**: ls -l /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh
