# Day 8: Install Ansible

### Task Overview
The DevOps team at Nautilus decided to install Ansible for automation and configuration management, and to install it on the jump server. The task asked me to install a specific version (4.7.0) of Ansible, using pip3 package manager, and to make sure it was available globally. 

The below listed command was sufficient to install Ansible in one go. "Sudo" was used to make it globally available, and "ansible==4.7.0" was used to install the specified version. I subsequently ran the "ansible --version" command to ensure it was correct. 

With each passing lab, I am becoming more aware of the importance of verifying things as I go. For one, I wouldn't pass the lab if it were wrong. Two, it provides a sort of quality assurance which itself will grow in importance, and can more than likely be automated as scale increases.

### Key Command Notes
* **To install Ansible with correct version, and to make it globally available**: sudo pip3 install --user ansible==4.7.0
* **To verify the installation**: ansible --version
