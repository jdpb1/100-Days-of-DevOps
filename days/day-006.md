# Day 6: Create a Cron Job

### Task Overview
Day 6 focused on Linux cron jobs for task automation. The lab tasked me with installing cronie, enabling the service, and creating a cron job to echo "hello world" every 5 minutes, for root users on three different servers. Scheduling recurring tasks, and across multiple servers, is a foundational skill for automation and will be useful later on. 

### Key Command Notes
* **To install cronie**: sudo dnf install cronie
* **To start enable and start cronie**: sudo systemctl enable crond
sudo systemctl start crond
* **To edit the root CronTab**: sudo crontab -e
* **The command given to echo hello world every 5 minutes**: */5 * * * * echo hello > /tmp/cron_text
* **To verify the cronjob is running**: 
sudo crontab -l
