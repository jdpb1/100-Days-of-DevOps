# Day 3: Secure Root SSH Access

### Task Overview
The task required removing root SSH logins. I completed this by editing the SSH configuration file and changing the "PermitRootLogin" flag to "no". This is best practice as attackers target the root account, so disabling it reduces the attack surface.

### Tools Used
* **SSH**: for secure remote terminal access
* **CLI Text Editor**: "vi" used to change SSH config file
* **Permissions**: Setting "PermitRootLogin no" solved the problem
* **Linux Services**: "systemctl" command used to restart the SSH service after a change was made to the config file

### Key Command Notes
sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
PermitRootLogin no
sudo systemctl restart sshd
