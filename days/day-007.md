# Day 7: Linux SSH Authentication

### Task Overview
Day 7 focused on Linux SSH Authentication. This involved setting up passwordless SSH access using public keys. Automation tools, pipelines, etc. often need such passwordless communication, so having learned this will be handy. 

The situation revolved around a user named Thor on a jump server, and three (sudo) users on three separate app servers. Thor (and the jump server) needed to connect to these app servers via SSH and without typing in a password each time. I had to first generate the SSH keys necessary for the connection, copy the public key over to the app servers (and verify with sudo user's password), and then test connection to verify.

### Key Command Notes
* **To generate the SSH key pair**: ssh-keygen -t rsa 
* **To copy the public key to each app server**: ssh-copy-id user@servername (had to type in each user's password once)
* **To verify the SSH connection**: ssh user@servername
