# Day 5: SElinux Installation and Configuration

### Task Overview
Day 5 required the installation of SELinux, which enhances the security of Linux with an access control system. The lab also stated SELinux needed to be disabled, which is sometimes necessary for troubleshooting. Generally you'd want to reboot the system after changing a config file, and use <i>sestatus</i> to check  the status of SELinux, but that is beyond the scope of this lab.

### Key Command Notes
* **To update the system**: sudo dnf update ("apt" was not found, so I used dnf)
* **To install SELinux Packages on Fedora/Red Hat-based distros**: sudo dnf install selinux-policy selinux-policy-targeted policycoreutils policycoreutils-python-utils setroubleshoot-server
* **To disable SELinux**: sudo vi /etc/selinux/config
SELinux = disabled
